# GodLocal Commercial License

**Copyright (C) 2026 Rostyslav Oliinyk — godlocal.ai**

## Why a Commercial License?

GodLocal is released under **AGPL-3.0** for the open-source community.

AGPL-3.0 requires that if you modify GodLocal and run it as a network service,
you must publish your modifications under AGPL-3.0.

If your organization **cannot comply** with this requirement — because you are
building a closed-source product, SaaS platform, or enterprise deployment —
you need a **Commercial License**.

## Who Needs a Commercial License?

| Internal corporate deployment, source stays private | **Commercial** |

| Medical / Healthcare product (HIPAA), closed source | **Commercial** |
