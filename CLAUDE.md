# CLAUDE.md — GodLocal AI Workflow Rules

> This file is auto-read by Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and compatible AI coding assistants.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at session start for the relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behaviour between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First:** Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan:** Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress:** Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes:** High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results:** Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons:** Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

---

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First:** Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness:** Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact:** Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## GodLocal-Specific Rules

- Always run `godlocal_v5.py` BEFORE `godlocal_telegram.py` (dependency order)
- Never commit `god_soul.md` — it's in `.gitignore` (private user data)
- `self_evolve.py` runs inside `sleep_cycle()` Phase 2 — don't call it standalone in tests
- All new modules must register in the 14-module manifest inside `godlocal_v5.py`
- Secrets live in `SecretsVault` — never hardcode API keys
- When adding a new command to `godlocal_telegram.py`, add the corresponding handler AND update the `/help` command list
