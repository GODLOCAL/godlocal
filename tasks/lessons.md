## [2026-02-24] — Initial bootstrap

**What this file does:**
- Records lessons from every sleep_cycle() run
- AI coding agents (Claude, Cursor) read this before writing new code
- Prevents repeating the same mistakes across sessions

**Bootstrap lessons:**
- Mac + phone setup failed → Steam Deck (SteamOS/Arch Linux) is primary test target
- Two-terminal stack required: godlocal_v5.py first, then godlocal_telegram.py
- god_soul.md drives all personality — keep it human and specific
- self_evolve.py integrated into sleep_cycle() Phase 2 (knowledge gap scanning)
